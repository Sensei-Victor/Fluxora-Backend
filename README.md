# Contract Event Indexer - Batch Replay Implementation

High-performance contract event indexer with optimized batch processing and PostgreSQL indexing for efficient historical event replay.

## 🚀 Features

- **Batch Insert Processing**: 50x faster than single-row inserts
- **Optimized Database Indexes**: Composite and partial indexes for replay queries
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor replay status with estimated completion times
- **Transaction Safety**: Full ACID compliance with automatic rollback
- **Security Hardened**: Parameterized queries, input validation, concurrent operation prevention
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 80%+ code coverage with edge case handling

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js **20.20.2** (exact, pinned; see [Node.js version](#nodejs-version))
- PostgreSQL 12+
- pnpm 9.15.9 (required)

## Node.js version

The service runs on exactly one Node.js version everywhere: **20.20.2**. The
same version is used locally, in CI and in the Docker image.

| Where | How it names the version |
| --- | --- |
| `.nvmrc` | `20.20.2` (source of truth; `nvm use` / `fnm use` read it) |
| `package.json` | `"engines": { "node": "20.20.2" }` |
| `Dockerfile` | `ARG NODE_VERSION=20.20.2` (both stages use `node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine`) |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | `actions/setup-node` with `node-version-file: '.nvmrc'` |

CI runs `node scripts/check-node-version.mjs` (also `pnpm run check:node-version`)
and fails when any of these disagree, or when a workflow or compose file names
some other Node.js version.

**Upgrading Node.js** is one reviewed pull request that changes `.nvmrc`,
`package.json` `engines.node`, the Dockerfile `ARG NODE_VERSION`, and the
version stated in this README. Run `pnpm run check:node-version` to confirm
nothing was missed.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Activate the package manager version pinned in package.json
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.9 --activate

# Install dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your database credentials
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/indexer_db
```

pnpm is the repository's only supported package manager, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`
is the authoritative dependency lockfile. The preinstall guard intentionally
rejects npm, Yarn, other package managers, and pnpm versions other than 9.15.9.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations to create tables and indexes
pnpm run migrate
```

This executes `tsx src/db/migrate.ts`, which uses **node-pg-migrate** as the
single migration runner.  All files in `migrations/` that begin with a numeric
timestamp prefix are applied in ascending numeric order and recorded in the
`pgmigrations` table.

### Migration file naming convention

```
<timestamp>_<description>.ts
```

| Range | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `1000000000000 – 1000000000999` | Bootstrapping tables converted from the legacy PoolClient runner (`000_*`, `001_*`, `002_*`) |
| `1774715131962 +` | Streams, audit, webhook-outbox, DLQ, and PII tables |
| `20260622000000 +` | Calendar-style additions (pagination indexes, pgcrypto, partitioning, …) |

Files without a leading digit (e.g. `run.ts`) are ignored by the scanner and
will never appear in the `pgmigrations` ledger.

### Adding a new migration

```bash
# Pick the current Unix-ms timestamp as the prefix
date +%s%3N   # e.g. 1750000000000

# Create the file
touch migrations/1750000000000_your_description.ts
```

Implement the `up(pgm: MigrationBuilder)` and `down(pgm: MigrationBuilder)`
functions using the node-pg-migrate API.  The `run.ts` file in `migrations/` is
a tombstone that exits with an error — do not use it directly.

This creates:
- `historical_events` table (source data)
- `contract_events` table (replay destination)
- Optimized indexes for replay queries
- Composite stream pagination indexes (`idx_streams_status_id`, `idx_streams_sender_id`,
  `idx_streams_contract_id`, `idx_streams_status_created_at_desc`) — see [docs/STREAMS.md](docs/STREAMS.md)

## 🏃 Running the Service

```bash
# Development mode
pnpm run dev

# Production build
pnpm run build
node dist/src/index.js
```

The service will start on port 3000 (configurable via `PORT` environment variable).

## 📡 API Usage

### Start a Replay

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/internal/indexer/events/replay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contract_id": "contract-abc-123",
    "ledger": 1,
    "from_block": 1000,
    "to_block": 2000
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Replay started",
  "status": {
    "isReplaying": true,
    "rowsReplayed": 0,
    "rowsRemaining": 1500,
    "totalRows": 1500,
    "estimatedCompletion": "2026-05-28T15:30:00.000Z",
    "startedAt": "2026-05-28T15:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Check Replay Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/internal/indexer/status
```

Response:
```json
{
  "isReplaying": true,
  "rowsReplayed": 750,
  "rowsRemaining": 750,
  "totalRows": 1500,
  "estimatedCompletion": "2026-05-28T15:30:00.000Z",
  "startedAt": "2026-05-28T15:00:00.000Z",
  "contractId": "contract-abc-123",
  "ledger": 1
}
```

### Scripted Database Operations & Partition Management

Scripted database backup, restore, and partition retention operations are managed via `src/scripts/db-ops.ts`.
- `backupDatabase` / `restoreDatabase`: Support local custom-format dumps as well as zero-disk S3 streaming.
- `dropOldPartitions`: Detaches and drops range partitions older than a specified threshold. Runs in `dryRun = true` mode by default.
- Destructive restore and partition-drop operations print their target environment, require an explicit `confirm: true` flag, and require `acknowledgeProduction: true` when targeting production. Use `dryRun: true` first to report the planned change.

For complete details on operator ergonomics, security controls, credential protection, and region resolution, see [docs/database.md](docs/database.md#scripted-database-operations--operator-ergonomics).

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run with coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Run specific test file
pnpm test tests/indexer/service.replay.test.ts
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- ✅ Input validation (invalid parameters)
- ✅ Empty replay sets
- ✅ Batch processing with various sizes
- ✅ Batch boundary alignment
- ✅ Duplicate event handling (ON CONFLICT)
- ✅ Concurrent replay prevention
- ✅ Transaction rollback on errors
- ✅ Progress tracking and estimation
- ✅ Block range filtering
- ✅ SQL injection prevention

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | - | PostgreSQL connection string (required) |
| `REPLAY_BATCH_SIZE` | 1000 | Number of events per batch insert |
| `PORT` | 3000 | HTTP server port |
| `API_KEYS` | - | Comma-separated list of valid API keys |
| `API_KEY_PEPPER` | - | Server-side pepper for API key hashing (**Required if API_KEYS is configured**) |
| `WEBHOOK_DNS_TIMEOUT_MS` | 2000 | Webhook DNS lookup resolution timeout in milliseconds (fail-closed) |


### Batch Size Tuning

- **Small (100-500)**: Lower memory, more round-trips
- **Medium (1000-2000)**: Balanced performance ⭐ recommended
- **Large (5000+)**: Faster bulk operations, higher memory

## 🔒 Security

### Implemented Protections

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**: All queries use parameterized statements
2. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all request parameters
3. **Concurrent Operation Prevention**: Only one replay at a time
4. **Transaction Safety**: Automatic rollback on errors
5. **Webhook Delivery Logging**: Outbound webhook dispatch logs use the shared structured logger and include only stable identifiers (`deliveryId`, `eventType`, `attemptNumber`) plus `statusCode` when available. Webhook secrets, raw payloads, signatures, and endpoint URLs are excluded from log metadata.

### Dependency Audit Enforcement

All dependencies are continuously audited for security vulnerabilities. Findings at **moderate severity or above** fail the build unless covered by an explicit, time-bound exception.

**Remediation windows:**
- Critical: 7 days (engineering lead approval required)
- High: 14 days (team lead approval required)
- Moderate: 30 days (peer review required)

Run audit checks locally:
```bash
# Run enforcing audit check (as used in CI)
pnpm run audit:check

# Validate exceptions file format
pnpm run audit:validate
```

See [docs/security/dependency-audit-policy.md](docs/security/dependency-audit-policy.md) for the complete exception process and remediation guidelines.

### Webhook Delivery Logging

The class-based `WebhookDispatcher` imports the shared structured logger from `src/lib/logger.ts` and uses the same `(message, correlationId?, meta?)` signature as other services. Dispatch outcomes log only safe delivery metadata:

- Success: `deliveryId`, `eventType`, `attemptNumber`, `statusCode`
- Retryable HTTP failure: `deliveryId`, `eventType`, `attemptNumber`, `statusCode`
- Permanent HTTP failure: `deliveryId`, `eventType`, `attemptNumber`, `statusCode`
- Network failure: `deliveryId`, `eventType`, `attemptNumber`

Target URLs, webhook secrets, signatures, and raw payloads are intentionally omitted from log records to avoid leaking credentials or signed delivery content.

### Production Recommendations

⚠️ The `/internal/indexer/*` endpoints are **not authenticated** by default.

Before deploying to production:

```typescript
// Add authentication middleware
import { authenticate } from './middleware/auth';

app.use('/internal', authenticate);
app.use('/internal/indexer', indexerRouter);
```

Additional recommendations:
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Add rate limiting
- Use API keys or JWT tokens
- Enable HTTPS/TLS

## 📊 Performance

### Batch Insert Performance

With `REPLAY_BATCH_SIZE=1000`:
- Single inserts: ~100-200 events/second
- Batch inserts: ~5,000-10,000 events/second

**50x improvement** in throughput.

### Index Impact

For a table with 10M events:
- Unindexed query: ~30-60 seconds
- Indexed query: ~10-50 milliseconds

## 📦 Client SDKs

Two generated clients are versioned in lockstep with the API and published from
tagged releases:

- **TypeScript** — `@fluxora/sdk` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluxora/sdk): `npm install @fluxora/sdk`
- **Python** — `fluxora-sdk` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fluxora-sdk/): `pip install fluxora-sdk`

Both SDK versions are copied from `openapi.yaml` `info.version` and are checked
by `pnpm check:sdk`. See [docs/sdk-publishing.md](docs/sdk-publishing.md) for the
versioning policy and release process.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Replay Times Out
- Reduce `REPLAY_BATCH_SIZE`
- Run during off-peak hours
- Add database resources

### High Memory Usage
- Reduce `REPLAY_BATCH_SIZE`
- Increase application heap size

### Concurrent Replay Error
- Check status: `GET /internal/indexer/status`
- Wait for current replay to complete

See [docs/indexer.md](docs/indexer.md) for detailed troubleshooting.

## Webhook resilience

Outbound webhook retries use two Redis-backed per-consumer controls:

- **Rate limiting** (`src/redis/webhookRateLimit.ts`): sliding-window cap via `WEBHOOK_RETRY_RPS` (default `10`/s).
- **Circuit breaker** (`src/redis/webhookCircuitBreakerStore.ts`): shared `closed` → `open` → `half-open` state keyed by SHA-256 hash of the consumer URL. After `circuitBreakerThreshold` consecutive failures, deliveries are deferred until `circuitBreakerResetMs`, then a single cross-instance probe is allowed.

`attemptWebhookDeliveryWithRateLimit` in `src/webhooks/retry.ts` applies both gates before each delivery. State transitions emit `fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total`. See [docs/webhooks.md](docs/webhooks.md) for the full transition table, the `WEBHOOK_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_*` thresholds, and `GET /internal/webhooks/circuit-breakers`, which reports per receiver whether deliveries are paused (`paused`/`reason`) and when they resume (`resumeAt`).

## Webhook Causal Ordering Guarantee

To ensure per-stream consumers always observe events in chain order, Fluxora guarantees a deterministic tiebreaker for webhook outbox deliveries. Items sharing the exact same `scheduledFor` timestamp are processed sequentially by applying a secondary sort on their `ledger` sequence (extracted from the JSON payload) and a tertiary sort on the `eventId`. This causal ordering is maintained securely across memory queues (`WebhookDeliveryStore`) and persistent database reads (`PostgreSQL webhook_outbox` query path), even when large sets of identical timestamps occur.

## Indexer Stall State and Recovery

The service health checks monitor indexer freshness to ensure downstream clients do not receive dangerously stale chain state. If the sync lag exceeds the configured threshold (`DEFAULT_INDEXER_STALL_THRESHOLD_MS`), the system latches an `isStalled` flag and degrades `/health/ready`.
Even if the indexer catches back up, **the stall flag remains latched** to alert operators of the transient instability. Operators can acknowledge and reset this flag via an admin endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/indexer/stall/clear \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>"
```
The endpoint returns `409 Conflict` if the indexer is still actively lagging behind the freshness threshold. Successful resets emit an `INDEXER_STALL_CLEARED` audit log.
