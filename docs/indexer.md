# Indexer Service

## Overview

The Fluxora indexer ingests contract events from the Stellar blockchain and
replays historical events into the `contract_events` table on demand.

## Replay Integrity Check

After every successful replay (triggered via `POST /events/replay` or auto-resume
on startup), the system runs an **asynchronous post-replay integrity check** that
validates the ledger-sequence contiguity of the freshly replayed data.

### What is checked

1. **Ledger gaps** — For the replayed contract and ledger range, the check
   materialises the expected ledger sequence (via `generate_series`) and compares
   it to the distinct ledgers actually present in `contract_events`. Any missing
   ledger is reported as a gap.

2. **Duplicate event entries** — The check groups `contract_events` rows by
   `(event_id, ledger)` and reports any group with `COUNT(*) > 1` as a duplicate.
   Although the INSERT path uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, duplicate detection
   catches corner cases like concurrent races or boundary bugs.

### When it runs

The check is **fire-and-forget** — it runs asynchronously after the replay
completion block (cursor marked complete, metrics recorded). It never blocks the
replay response path.

- After `IndexerService.replayEvents()` completes successfully
- After `IndexerService.resumeIncompleteReplay()` completes

### Failure mode

The integrity check **never throws**. On detection of issues:

1. A `REPLAY_INTEGRITY_ISSUE` entry is written to the `audit_logs` table
2. Prometheus counters are incremented:
   - `indexer_replay_integrity_gaps_total` (label: `contract_id`)
   - `indexer_replay_integrity_duplicates_total` (label: `contract_id`)
3. A structured warning is logged (event: `replay_integrity_issues_detected`)

If the underlying DB query fails, the error is logged and silently swallowed.

### Efficiency

Both checks are scoped to a single `(contract_id, ledger-range)` pair and use
indexed lookups — never a full-table scan. The gap check uses `generate_series`
to materialise the expected ledger list without pulling all rows.

The maximum checked range is **100 000 ledgers** (`MAX_INTEGRITY_RANGE`). If the
replay span exceeds this, the range is clamped from the tail and a warning is
logged. This prevents OOM in pathological cases.

### Source

- **Module**: `src/indexer/replayIntegrity.ts`
- **Metrics**: `src/metrics/indexerMetrics.ts`
- **Integration**: `src/indexer/service.ts`

### Testing

Tests are in `tests/indexer/replayIntegrity.test.ts` and cover:

- Clean pass (gap-free)
- Single and multiple gap detection
- Per-contract scoping (gaps in one contract don't affect another)
- Multiple events per ledger (no false positives)
- Duplicate event detection
- Empty range handling
- Range clamping
- DB error handling (caught gracefully)
- Audit event recording
- Prometheus counter increment/decrement
- Contract ID label truncation
- Integration with IndexerService

## Backfill Scheduling and Live-Indexing Yield

`src/indexer/backfillScheduler.ts` runs historical backfill as a background,
best-effort workload with **bounded concurrency** and an **ordered
checkpoint**. Live (tip-following) indexing always has priority: a backfill
that runs flat out during a busy period competes for the same RPC and database
capacity and *increases* the ledger lag that `src/metrics/indexerLag.ts`
measures — the opposite of what the operator wanted.

### The schedule

1. Batches are processed in ascending `index` order, with at most `concurrency`
   handlers in flight at once.
2. Before a worker claims its next batch it reads the **live-indexing lag**
   (the same quantity as the `indexer_ledger_lag` gauge, i.e. tip minus
   last-indexed ledger) via the `liveIndexingLag` callback.
3. If the lag is **greater than or equal to** `maxLiveIndexingLag`, the worker
   waits and starts no new batch. The backfill is now **paused**.
4. While paused, the lag is re-checked every `yieldPollIntervalMs`. As soon as
   it falls **below** the threshold, the backfill **resumes automatically** — no
   operator action and no restart required.
5. All workers share a single pause gate, so one sustained lagging period emits
   exactly one `paused` → `resumed` transition, regardless of `concurrency`.

Yielding is **disabled** — and the scheduler behaves exactly as before — when
`liveIndexingLag` is omitted or `maxLiveIndexingLag` is `<= 0` (the default).

A lag reader that throws is treated as “no lag recorded” so a transient
metrics/DB glitch cannot stall the backfill forever; the failed read is not
surfaced as a batch failure.

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `liveIndexingLag` | — | Reader for the current live-indexing lag in ledgers. Omit to disable yielding. |
| `maxLiveIndexingLag` | `0` (disabled) | Pause while lag `>=` this value. Must be `> 0` to enable yielding. |
| `yieldPollIntervalMs` | `1000` | Interval between lag re-checks while paused. |
| `onYield` | — | Called once per pause, with the triggering lag. |
| `onResume` | — | Called once per resume, with the lag observed at resumption. |

### Observability

The pause/resume decision is observable three ways:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `onYield(lag)` / `onResume(lag)` callbacks | Per-scheduler decisions, for callers that persist or forward them |
| `indexer_backfill_paused` gauge | `1` while paused, `0` while running |
| `indexer_backfill_yield_events_total{event}` | `paused` / `resumed` transition counts |

An operator alert can be written as “the backfill has been paused for more than
N minutes”, which is a direct signal that live indexing is behind.

### Validation

`tests/indexer/backfillScheduler.test.ts` exercises the condition against the
real scheduler and asserts the documented outcome:

- **Pauses when live indexing lags** — with a lag above the threshold no handler
  is invoked until the lag drops.
- **Resumes automatically** — once the lag falls below the threshold the
  remaining batches are processed without any new call.
- **Reports the decision once** — a sustained lagging period with several
  concurrent workers yields exactly one `onYield` and one `onResume`.
- **Runs unchanged when disabled** — omitting `liveIndexingLag` (or setting
  `maxLiveIndexingLag <= 0`) never pauses.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INDEXER_REPLAY_BUDGET_MS` | `0` (no budget) | Max wall-clock duration for a single replay run |
| `INDEXER_REPLAY_BATCH_SIZE` | `100` | Rows per batch |
| `INDEXER_MAX_REPLAY_RANGE_BLOCKS` | `0` (unlimited) | Max block range per replay request |

## gRPC Gateway Resource Policy

When `GRPC_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`, the internal indexer gateway accepts messages
up to **4 MiB** and sends responses under the same limit. Each unary handler is
bounded by a **30-second** server-side deadline. Calls cancelled by the client
are treated as terminal: the gateway removes its cancellation listener, skips
late callbacks, and does not retry ingest or replay work because completion
cannot be inferred from a cancelled RPC. Oversized requests are rejected by
gRPC with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`; deadline expiry returns `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`.

These limits are implemented in `src/indexer/grpcGateway.ts` and covered by
`tests/indexer/grpcGateway.test.ts`. The policy bounds gateway buffers and
handler lifetime; it does not cancel an already-running database operation.
