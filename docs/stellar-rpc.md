# Stellar RPC Resilience

Fluxora wraps Stellar RPC calls with a circuit breaker and a last-known-good fallback cache.

## Circuit Breaker States

| State | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOSED` | Normal operation. RPC calls are attempted and successful responses refresh the fallback cache. |
| `OPEN` | The provider is considered unhealthy. The service attempts to serve the matching cached response before throwing `CircuitOpenError`. |
| `HALF_OPEN` | A cool-off period has elapsed. One probe call is attempted against the provider; success closes the circuit and refreshes cache, failure reopens it. |

The breaker is configured with `RPC_CB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, `RPC_CB_WINDOW_MS`, `RPC_CB_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS`, and `RPC_TIMEOUT_MS`. These values, retry settings, cache settings, health-check settings, and optional per-operation deadlines are validated by `src/config/env.ts` before startup. Invalid values fail startup instead of being silently replaced by `parseInt`/`parseFloat` fallbacks.

## RPC Retries

Individual RPC calls (such as fetching the latest ledger or checking account existence) are automatically wrapped in a retry loop using a shared decorrelated jitter helper. If a *retryable* error occurs and the circuit is not open, the request is retried up to `STELLAR_RPC_MAX_RETRIES` times (default 3) before failing, with a base delay of `STELLAR_RPC_RETRY_DELAY` (default 1000ms). Jitter ensures that concurrent callers do not thunder-herd the RPC provider.

`STELLAR_RPC_OPERATION_DEADLINES` accepts a JSON object such as `{"getLatestLedger":2000,"accountExists":8000}`. Every deadline must be a positive integer number of milliseconds.

### Read vs. submit fallback policy

Every operation this service currently exposes — `getLatestLedger` and `accountExists` — is a **read**: side-effect-free and safe to repeat any number of times. Retrying reads carries no risk of duplicate submissions, so retry decisions only need to ask "can this plausibly succeed on a second attempt?", not "is it safe to attempt again?". There is presently no submit/write RPC path (e.g. transaction submission) in this service; if one is added, it must carry its own idempotency key (e.g. the transaction hash) so a client-side retry after an ambiguous network failure cannot result in a duplicate on-chain submission — retrying a submit call blindly under this same policy would be unsafe.

### Retryable status classes

`isRetryableRpcError` (in `src/services/stellar-rpc.ts`) classifies every `RpcProviderError` raised by a call site before a retry is attempted:

| Condition | Retried? | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TIMEOUT` / `NETWORK` kind | Yes | Connection-level hiccups are plausibly transient. |
| `PROVIDER` kind, HTTP 429 | Yes | Rate limiting is expected to clear; backoff gives the provider room. |
| `PROVIDER` kind, HTTP 5xx | Yes | Upstream server errors are plausibly transient. |
| `PROVIDER` kind, HTTP 4xx (other than 429) | No | A permanent client/request error — retrying cannot change the outcome. |
| `PROVIDER` kind, no HTTP status (config error, malformed response) | No | Permanent by construction (e.g. a missing `horizonUrl`) — retrying would only add latency and could mask the real error behind a generic timeout. |
| `CANCELLED` kind | No | The caller explicitly aborted the request. |

Only errors that have already been classified into an `RpcProviderError` by the service's own call sites are evaluated this way; a raw transport error thrown directly by a `RawRpcClient` implementation is left to the outer per-call timeout instead of being retried, so a single call's overall timeout budget can never be silently multiplied by per-attempt backoff sleeps.

## Fallback Cache

Successful RPC responses are stored in Redis under keys beginning with `rpc:cache::`. The default TTL is 300 seconds and can be changed with `RPC_FALLBACK_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`.

Each cache write stores a small metadata envelope next to the response value: write time, expiry time, configured TTL, and the last refresh duration. Readers remain compatible with older raw JSON entries, but only envelope entries can participate in early refresh.

Cache keys use fixed operation names. Parameterized calls, such as account existence checks, include a SHA-256 hash of the parameter rather than raw account data. This prevents key injection, keeps key length bounded, and avoids writing account identifiers into Redis keys.

When the circuit is `CLOSED`, the fallback cache can smooth hot-key TTL boundaries with XFetch-style probabilistic early expiry. If an entry is close enough to expiry, one request starts a background refresh while the current request still receives the cached value. Concurrent callers keep receiving the cached value and do not all stampede the Stellar RPC provider.

The early-expiry beta factor is controlled by `RPC_FALLBACK_CACHE_EARLY_EXPIRY_BETA`:

- Default: `0` (disabled).
- Set a positive value, such as `1`, to enable closed-circuit cache reads and early refresh.
- Larger values refresh earlier and more aggressively.

When the circuit is `OPEN`:

1. A cache hit returns the stale last-known-good response and increments `rpc_circuit_open_fallback_hits_total`.
2. A cache miss increments `rpc_circuit_open_fallback_misses_total` and propagates `CircuitOpenError`.
3. HTTP requests executed through `rpcDegradationMiddleware` include `X-RPC-Cache: stale` when a stale RPC response was used.

Closed-circuit cache behavior emits:

  - `rpc_fallback_cache_hits_total`
  - `rpc_fallback_cache_misses_total`
  - `rpc_fallback_cache_early_refreshes_total`
  - `fluxora_rpc_cache_corrupt_total`

Redis cache read/write failures are logged as warnings and treated as misses or no-op writes. The fallback cache must not become a hard dependency for normal RPC calls.

## Degradation Mode (HTTP Responses)

`rpcDegradationMiddleware` turns circuit-breaker state into an explicit,
self-describing HTTP contract so callers can always tell degraded data from
fresh data.

### Entry criteria

The backend is **degraded** whenever the circuit breaker is not `CLOSED`
(i.e. `OPEN` or `HALF_OPEN`). The breaker trips to `OPEN` once
`RPC_CB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` (default 5) failures are observed within
`RPC_CB_WINDOW_MS` (default 30 000 ms), and it stays `OPEN` for
`RPC_CB_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 60 000 ms) before a probe is admitted.

### Markers on every response

| Header / outcome | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `X-Degradation-State` | `CLOSED` / `OPEN` / `HALF_OPEN` | Current circuit state; present on every response. |
| `Warning` | `199 fluxora-backend "Stellar RPC unavailable - data may be stale"` | Set on allowed read requests (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) while degraded. |
| `X-RPC-Cache` | `stale` | Set when the body came from the last-known-good fallback cache instead of a live RPC call. |
| `503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | body `degradation: { circuitState, failureCount, openedAt }` | Mutating requests (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) are rejected while degraded. |

### Exit / automatic recovery

Recovery is automatic: after the reset timeout elapses, the next call is
admitted as a `HALF_OPEN` probe. A successful probe closes the breaker and
normal responses resume; a failed probe reopens it. No manual intervention is
required.

### Observability

Entry to and exit from degradation are logged (`event:
rpc_degradation_transition`) and exported as Prometheus metrics:

- `rpc_degradation_transitions_total{from,to}` — incremented on each observed
  transition, e.g. `{from="CLOSED",to="OPEN"}` for entry and
  `{from="OPEN",to="CLOSED"}` for automatic recovery.
- `rpc_degraded_mode` — gauge, `1` while degraded and `0` when healthy.

## Security Notes

- Cached values are JSON only and are parsed with `JSON.parse`; no dynamic code execution is used.
- Raw account addresses are URL-encoded for Horizon requests and hashed before use in Redis cache keys.
- Redis credentials come from environment configuration and are never logged.
- Stale fallback responses are served only while the circuit breaker is `OPEN`; `HALF_OPEN` uses live probe calls.
