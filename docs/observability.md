# Observability

## Prometheus scrape configuration

`GET /metrics` is protected by the same `ADMIN_API_KEY` Bearer token used by other admin routes. Prometheus scrape jobs must supply the token via the `Authorization` header.

### Environment variable

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Shared secret for admin and metrics access. Required — the endpoint returns `503` when unset. |

### Prometheus `scrape_configs` example

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: fluxora
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: <ADMIN_API_KEY value>
```

### Response codes

| Status | Cause |
|--------|-------|
| `200` | Valid token — metrics payload returned |
| `401` | Missing or malformed `Authorization` header |
| `403` | Token present but incorrect |
| `503` | `ADMIN_API_KEY` not configured on the server |

## Slow-query logging

Every repository method in `src/db/repositories/streamRepository.ts` is instrumented with a Prometheus histogram.

### Metric

```
fluxora_db_query_duration_seconds{repository="streamRepository",operation="upsertStream"} ...
```

| Label | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `repository` | `streamRepository` | Source repository |
| `operation` | `upsertStream`, `updateStream`, `getById`, `getByEvent`, `findWithCursor`, `find`, `countByStatus` | Method name |

**Buckets (seconds):** 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10

p99 SLO query:

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(fluxora_db_query_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

---

## Slow-Query Logging (SIEM Integration)

Every PostgreSQL query is timed. When duration ≥ `SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD_MS`, a structured OCSF log entry is emitted and a Prometheus counter is incremented.

## Server-Timing response header

Fluxora can return a W3C-compatible `Server-Timing` response header for the streams API so browser developer tools and ad-hoc debugging can see a compact latency breakdown without enabling the OpenTelemetry backend.

### How it works

- Middleware creates a request-scoped registry attached to `res.locals` when `SERVER_TIMING_ENABLED=true`.
- Streams route handlers record named phases by pushing sanitized values into the registry. Current streams responses include `db` and `serialize`; paths that make Stellar RPC calls may also record `stellar_rpc`.
- Responses without recorded phases omit the header, even when the feature is enabled.
- The header is gated by environment and caller to prevent information disclosure and timing-oracle attacks.

### Environment & Caller Gating

To protect backend architecture topology and prevent timing-oracle attacks in production:

1. **Production Configuration (`NODE_ENV=production`)**:
   - **Absent by default**: Detailed stage timings are absent for public, unauthenticated, and unauthorized callers, regardless of `SERVER_TIMING_ENABLED`.
   - **Authorized & Opt-in Only**: Timing headers are ONLY emitted if the caller is **both** authorized **and** has explicitly opted in.
   - **Component Name Masking**: Timing names emitted in production are automatically masked to architecture-neutral, abstract tier names (e.g., `data`, `render`, `upstream`, `lookup`, `job`, `security`) or a generic `process` label. Internal component names (such as `db`, `postgres`, `serialize`, `stellar_rpc`) are never revealed to callers.

2. **Development / Test Configuration (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`)**:
   - When `SERVER_TIMING_ENABLED=true`, detailed stage timings (e.g., `db`, `serialize`, `stellar_rpc`) are emitted directly to facilitate local debugging and browser DevTools profiling.
   - Component name masking can optionally be forced via `SERVER_TIMING_MASK_COMPONENTS=true` or middleware options.

### Authorization Requirements (Production)

A caller is authorized to receive timing metrics in production if any of the following criteria are met:
- JWT identity carrying an `admin`, `operator`, or `data-protection-officer` role, or an administrative permission (`admin:pause`, `admin:reindex`, `timing:read`).
- API key (`X-API-Key`) containing `admin`, `operator`, or `timing` scopes.
- Shared secret match via `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>` or dedicated `X-Server-Timing-Key: <SERVER_TIMING_SECRET>`.

### Opt-In Signals

Authorized callers must explicitly opt in to timing emission via any of the following mechanisms:
- Request Header: `X-Server-Timing: 1` (or `true`, `enabled`)
- Request Header: `Server-Timing: 1` (or `true`, `enabled`)
- Request Header: `Prefer: server-timing`
- Query Parameter: `?timing=1` (or `?timing=true`, `?server-timing=1`)

### Security guarantees

- The header contains no hostnames, query strings, URLs, or PII.
- Phase names are restricted to a safe token format and durations are rounded to milliseconds.
- Internal component names are masked in production so no infrastructure details or component layers are disclosed.
- The feature is disabled by default and adds negligible overhead when `SERVER_TIMING_ENABLED` is unset or false.

### Examples

**Development environment (`NODE_ENV=development`):**
```http
Server-Timing: db;dur=12.5, serialize;dur=3.75
```

**Production environment (`NODE_ENV=production`, authorized and opt-in caller):**
```http
Server-Timing: data;dur=12.5, render;dur=3.75
```

**Production environment (unauthorized or default request):**
*(Header is omitted entirely)*

### Prometheus Counter

```
fluxora_db_slow_queries_total{table_hint="streams"} 3
```

## Server-Sent Events (SSE) observability
Counter name: `fluxora_db_slow_queries_total`  
Label: `table_hint` — the extracted table name (or `unknown`).  
Scraped at: `GET /metrics`

> Slow queries are counted on the **failure path too**: a query that hangs and is then canceled by `statement_timeout` still increments `fluxora_db_slow_queries_total`, so the counter keeps rising during an incident instead of flatlining.

Every failed query is also recorded by `fluxora_db_query_errors_total{error_type}`, where `error_type` is a bounded enum (`pool_exhausted`, `query_timeout`, `duplicate_entry`, `other`). Alert when the failure rate is non-zero:

```promql
# warning — any query failing for 5 minutes
rate(fluxora_db_query_errors_total[5m]) > 0
```

## Prometheus scrape configuration
## Prometheus scrape configuration & Access Rules

`GET /metrics` exposes internal operational metrics (traffic volumes, error rates, tenant counts, and component latencies) and is strictly protected from public access.

### Authorization & Access Control
- **Static Bearer Token**: `GET /metrics` requires a valid Bearer token matching the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable (`Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>`).
- **JWT Authorization**: Requests carrying a signed JWT with the `admin` or `data-protection-officer` role are also authorized.
- **Fail-Closed**: When `ADMIN_API_KEY` is not configured, the service fails closed and refuses all requests with `503 Service Unavailable`.
- **Refusal & Logging**: Unauthenticated or unauthorized requests are refused immediately (401, 403, or 503) and logged as structured security warnings containing the request path, method, and client IP. No token or secret material is ever logged.

### Network Interface & Internal Boundary
In production deployments, the metrics endpoint must not be exposed to the public internet:
- **Internal Interface Binding**: Ingress controllers, API gateways, or reverse proxies (such as Nginx, Traefik, or AWS ALB) must block external routing to `/metrics`.
- **Private Scraping VPC**: Prometheus scrape jobs should access `/metrics` over internal VPC networks, private subnets, or dedicated management interfaces.

### Cardinality & Privacy Guarantees
- **No Per-User PII**: Metric labels are bounded to low-cardinality enum values (e.g. `method`, `route`, `status_code`, `outcome`, `status`, `reason`).
- **No High-Cardinality User Identifiers**: Per-user identifiers, Stellar wallet addresses (`G...`), email addresses, user IDs, or API keys are strictly forbidden from metric label dimensions to prevent cardinality explosion and PII leakage in observability systems.

### Environment variable

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Shared secret for admin and metrics access. Required — the endpoint returns `503` when unset. |

### Prometheus `scrape_configs` example

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: fluxora
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: <ADMIN_API_KEY value>
```

### Response codes

| Status | Cause | Logging |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `200` | Valid `ADMIN_API_KEY` or admin JWT token — metrics payload returned | Standard request log |
| `401` | Missing or malformed `Authorization` header | Warning logged with path, method, client IP |
| `403` | Token present but incorrect, or insufficient JWT role | Warning logged with path, method, client IP |
| `503` | `ADMIN_API_KEY` not configured on the server | Warning logged with path, method, client IP |

## Runtime Performance Metrics

The application exposes fine-grained Node.js runtime health indicators to differentiate garbage collection pressure from event loop starvation during load spikes.

### Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `fluxora_nodejs_heap_used_bytes` | Gauge | Node.js heap used size in bytes. |
| `fluxora_nodejs_heap_total_bytes` | Gauge | Node.js heap total size in bytes. |
| `fluxora_nodejs_external_bytes` | Gauge | Node.js external memory size in bytes. |
| `fluxora_nodejs_event_loop_lag_seconds` | Histogram | Event loop lag measured via a `setTimeout` probe. Buckets: 0.005 to 10 seconds. |

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `METRICS_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS` | `10000` | The interval in milliseconds at which to sample runtime metrics. |

### Alert Thresholding Strategy

- **Event Loop Lag**: Alert if p99 lag `> 1s` (indicates severe event loop starvation or long-running synchronous work).
- **Heap Pressure**: Alert if `fluxora_nodejs_heap_used_bytes` is consistently `> 85%` of `fluxora_nodejs_heap_total_bytes` over a sustained period (indicates GC thrashing).

## Trace-Enriched Error Logs

Every error-level log emitted by the centralized error handler (`src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`)
automatically carries the current OpenTelemetry `traceId` and `spanId` when a distributed trace
is active, enabling operators to jump from a log line straight to the corresponding trace in
Jaeger, Datadog, or any other OTLP-compatible backend.

### Fields

When a tracing context is active, error log JSON records include these two additional fields:

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `traceId` | `trace.getActiveSpan().spanContext().traceId` | W3C 32-hex-char trace ID linking all spans in the distributed trace |
| `spanId` | `trace.getActiveSpan().spanContext().spanId` | W3C 16-hex-char span ID of the request's root span |

These fields are read from the same OTel `AsyncLocalStorage` context used by the rest of
`src/tracing/hooks.ts` (via `getActiveTraceSpanIds()`) so every log line and every emitted
span share a single source of truth for trace identity.

### Example log entry (with active trace)

```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-30T12:00:00.000Z",
  "message": "API error: Validation failed",
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "statusCode": 400,
  "requestId": "abc-def-123",
  "traceId": "0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c",
  "spanId": "b7ad6b7169203331"
}
```

### Graceful degradation

When no tracing context is active (e.g. background jobs outside a request span, tracing
disabled, or OTel SDK not initialised), the `traceId` and `spanId` fields are simply
**absent** from the log record. The error handler never throws due to a missing trace
context — its core function of logging the error and returning a response to the client
is never compromised.

### PII safety

The `traceId` and `spanId` values are opaque hex strings generated by the tracing
infrastructure. They contain no PII, no request payload, and no credential material.
These fields are logged to stderr only and are **never** exposed in HTTP response bodies.

### Affected source files

- `src/tracing/hooks.ts` — `getActiveTraceSpanIds()` helper
- `src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` — enriches all error log calls with trace context
- `tests/errors.traceEnrichment.test.ts` — comprehensive tests including graceful
  degradation, failure safety, and PII assertions

## WebSocket Backpressure Gauges

When a single WebSocket subscriber stops reading from its socket, the kernel-level send buffer fills up and the hub eventually starts dropping frames or terminating the connection. Until that point, the global `BackpressureMetrics` only tell you *how often* drops happened, not *which* connection is consuming the most buffer.

The per-client gauges below expose `ws.bufferedAmount` directly so operators can pinpoint the offending peer before the hub escalates to drop/terminate.

### Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes` | Gauge | `connection_id` (UUID v4) | Current `ws.bufferedAmount` per connected `/ws/streams` client, in bytes. Sampled every 5s by the hub's collector and rounded to non-negative integers. |
| `fluxora_ws_max_buffered_bytes` | Gauge | — | Maximum `ws.bufferedAmount` observed across all live clients at the most recent sample. Useful for dashboards: spikes here precede drops. |
| `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` | Gauge | — | Count of live clients whose `bufferedAmount` exceeds the slow threshold (default 1 MiB). |
| `fluxora_ws_connection_health_total` | Gauge | `status` (closed set: `healthy`, `stalled`, `unhealthy`) | Live connections by health status. `stalled` counts `OPEN` connections whose outbound queue is saturated above `healthProbeStallBytes` (default 1 MiB) — an open-but-not-draining connection is reported as stalled, never healthy. Cardinality is fixed at 3. |
| `fluxora_ws_broadcast_batch_flush_seconds` | Histogram | — | Age in seconds of the oldest event included in a micro-batched WebSocket broadcast flush. Bounded O(1) cardinality (zero labels). |

### Micro-Batch Broadcast Flush Latency

When WebSocket broadcast micro-batching (flush-window coalescing) is enabled via `flushWindowMs > 0`, events are held briefly to coalesce outbound socket frames. Operators tune `flushWindowMs` to balance network frame overhead against delivery latency.

`fluxora_ws_broadcast_batch_flush_seconds` records, per batch flush, the age (in seconds) of the oldest event included in that flush.

**Bucket layout (seconds):**  
`0.0001` (0.1ms), `0.0005` (0.5ms), `0.001` (1ms), `0.0025` (2.5ms), `0.005` (5ms), `0.01` (10ms), `0.025` (25ms), `0.05` (50ms), `0.1` (100ms), `0.25` (250ms), `0.5` (500ms), `1.0` (1s), `2.5` (2.5s), `5.0` (5s).

**Zero-Overhead Guarantee:**  
When micro-batching is disabled (default `flushWindowMs: 0`, single-event-per-frame mode), this metric is a complete no-op with zero runtime overhead and zero histogram observations recorded.

### Label cardinality and security

The only label is `connection_id`, which is a server-generated **UUID v4** produced in `StreamHub.onConnect` (`randomUUID()` from `node:crypto`). It is **never** derived from:

- The client IP address (`ws.remoteAddress`)
- The authenticated JWT subject or any JWT claim
- The `correlationId` header
- Any client-controlled input

Series for disconnected clients are explicitly removed via the prom-client `Gauge.remove(...)` API in `StreamHub.onDisconnect`, so the cardinality of the per-client gauge is bounded by **peak concurrent connections**, not by the total number of historical connections. This prevents:

- **Memory exhaustion** by an attacker that repeatedly connects/disconnects to inflate the metric label set.
- **PII leakage** through labels — even an attacker that controls the client cannot influence the label value.

The aggregated `fluxora_ws_max_buffered_bytes` and `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` carry no labels and contribute zero additional cardinality.

### Configuration

| StreamHub option | Default | Description |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| `backpressureCollector.intervalMs` | `5000` | Poll interval. Set to `0` to disable the periodic collector entirely (gauge updates still happen during broadcast / send activity). |
| `backpressureCollector.slowThresholdBytes` | `1048576` (1 MiB) | Threshold above which a client is counted in `fluxora_ws_slow_clients`. |
| `healthProbeStallBytes` | `1048576` (1 MiB) | Outbound `bufferedAmount` above which an `OPEN` connection is counted in `fluxora_ws_connection_health_total{status="stalled"}` instead of `healthy`. Defaults to `BACKPRESSURE_DROP_BYTES`. |

### PromQL examples

Top-5 clients by current buffered bytes:

```promql
topk(5, fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes)
```

Any client approaching the terminate threshold (4 MiB), with 1 MB headroom:

```promql
max(fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes) > 4194304
```

Alert: more than 5 slow clients sustained over 5 minutes:

```promql
fluxora_ws_slow_clients > 5
```

Alert: any open connection stalled beyond a heartbeat interval (2 minutes):

```promql
fluxora_ws_connection_health_total{status="stalled"} > 0
```

### Thresholding strategy

- **`fluxora_ws_slow_clients > 0` for > 2 min**: investigate the highest entries of `topk(5, fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes)` and look for one or two clients with `correlation_id` entries repeated in the structured `ws_backpressure` warning logs.
- **`max(fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes) > 4 MiB`** (terminate threshold): one or more clients are about to be force-closed by the hub. Operators can proactively identify the offending connection via `topk(1, fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes)`.
- **`fluxora_ws_max_buffered_bytes` rising without `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` rising**: one client is filling up but stays below the slow threshold — still worth checking `topk(1, ...)` to confirm it's not unbounded.
- **`fluxora_ws_connection_health_total{status="stalled"} > 0` for > 2 min**: at least one `OPEN` connection is not draining its outbound queue (network partition or wedged consumer). Cross-reference `topk(5, fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes)` to identify the peer before the hub escalates to drop/terminate.

### Affected source files

- `src/metrics/wsBackpressure.ts` — gauge definitions + collector helpers
- `src/ws/hub.ts` — starts the collector and removes the per-client series on disconnect
- `tests/ws/hub.perClientGauge.test.ts` — bounded-cardinality / rise-then-clear assertions

## WebSocket Subscription Cardinality Gauge

A single stream with an unusually large subscriber count can drive disproportionate broadcast fan-out, consuming CPU and network bandwidth while increasing backpressure risk for every other stream. The subscription cardinality gauge reports the subscriber count for the top-N most-subscribed streams so operators can identify hot streams before they cause incidents.

### Metric

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count` | Gauge | `stream_id` (application-assigned stream identifier) | Subscriber count for the top-N WebSocket streams by fan-out size. Only the N most-subscribed streams are reported (default N = 20). |

### Label cardinality and security

The `stream_id` label is the opaque stream identifier assigned by the application. It does not contain PII, client IPs, JWT subjects, or any user-controlled data.

Cardinality is bounded by `DEFAULT_WS_STREAM_CARDINALITY_TOP_N` (20) — at most 20 time-series are emitted at any point. The collector sorts streams by subscriber count descending, keeps the top N, and explicitly removes stale series for streams that drop below the N-th rank between collection cycles. This prevents:

- **Unbounded label growth** when many low-subscriber streams exist — only the top 20 are exposed.
- **Stale series** lingering after a stream's subscribers leave — stale labels are cleaned up on the next collection cycle.

An attacker cannot inflate Prometheus memory by creating many streams with a handful of subscribers each, because only the top-N are ever exposed regardless of how many total streams exist.

### Configuration

| Constant | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_WS_STREAM_CARDINALITY_TOP_N` | `20` | Maximum number of streams reported by the gauge. Exported from `src/metrics/wsBackpressure.ts`. |

### PromQL examples

Top-5 streams by subscriber count:

```promql
topk(5, fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)
```

Alert: any single stream with more than 500 subscribers (potential hot-stream):

```promql
fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count > 500
```

Total subscribers across all top-N streams (approximation of broadcast fan-out):

```promql
sum(fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)
```

### Thresholding strategy

- **`max(fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count) > 500` for > 5 min**: investigate the identified hot stream. High fan-out magnifies the cost of every broadcast event — one slow client can trigger backpressure for all other subscribers on that stream.
- **`topk(1, fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)` divergence from `sum(fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)`**: one stream dominates the total subscriber count, indicating fan-out concentration risk.
- **Correlation with `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` rising**: a hot stream with slow clients compounds backpressure; identify the stream from the cardinality gauge and the slow clients from the per-client backpressure gauge.

### Affected source files

- `src/metrics/wsBackpressure.ts` — `wsStreamSubscriberCount` gauge definition + `collectStreamSubscriberCardinality` helper
- `src/ws/hub.ts` — `_getStreamSubscriptions()` accessor exposing the internal `streamSubscriptions` map
- `tests/ws/hub.subscriptionCardinality.test.ts` — top-N cap, stale-series removal, empty-hub, and reset assertions

## Authentication Latency Histograms

Auth runs on every protected request path. When the JWT verifier, revocation-store lookup, or API-key store becomes a bottleneck, these histograms give a distribution view (p50/p95/p99) and a split by success/failure — without leaking credential material.

### Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `fluxora_auth_jwt_verify_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `outcome` (`success` \| `failure`) | Time spent in `verifyToken()` (the cryptographic verify only — does NOT include revocation check or schema parse). Recorded by `src/middleware/auth.ts`. |
| `fluxora_auth_apikey_lookup_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `outcome` (`success` \| `failure`) | Time spent in API-key lookups. Recorded by `src/lib/apiKey.ts::isValidApiKey` and `src/middleware/adminAuth.ts::requireAdminAuth`. |

### Bucket layout

The bucket boundaries are intentionally bounded and tuned for each call site:

```text
fluxora_auth_jwt_verify_duration_seconds:        0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1
fluxora_auth_apikey_lookup_duration_seconds:     0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05
```

Range rationale:

- JWT verify buckets span 1 ms → 1 s. The measurement covers `verifyToken()` alone; the trailing revocation-check and schema-parse steps are intentionally excluded so an `outcome=success` observation reflects only successful cryptographic verification. A 401 caused by a downstream revocation hit or token-schema mismatch will appear as `outcome=success` on this histogram and is observable separately through the HTTP error-rate counter.
- API-key lookup buckets span 100 µs → 50 ms because the in-memory store does a SHA-256 + `timingSafeEqual`, but a future DB-backed store (tracked separately) would shift the distribution to the millisecond range.

### Security & label-cardinality guarantees

The label set is intentionally restricted to a single `outcome` label. The metrics must **never** carry credential material. The following labels are forbidden both now and in future iterations:

### Subscriber callback errors

When a live SSE subscriber callback throws, Fluxora keeps fan-out isolated (other subscribers still run) but emits both:

1. a structured error log
2. a Prometheus counter

**Metric**

- Name: `fluxora_sse_subscriber_errors_total`
- Type: Counter
- Label: `reason` (bounded enum)

This metric increments on thrown subscriber callbacks.

**Security**

SSE payloads and other stream-level data are not included in the log/metric labels (only `streamId` is logged; the payload is not logged).


## Webhook Circuit Breaker Metrics

Outbound webhook delivery uses a per-consumer-URL circuit breaker to avoid hammering failing endpoints.
The `fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total` counter tracks every state change so operators
can build dashboards and alert on consumer endpoint degradation.

### `fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total`

A Prometheus **Counter** that increments on every circuit-breaker state transition.

| Label | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `from_state` | `closed`, `open`, `half-open` | State before the transition |
| `to_state` | `closed`, `open`, `half-open` | State after the transition |
| `consumer_hash` | 16-char hex string | SHA-256 of the consumer URL, truncated to 16 hex characters |

**Cardinality bounds:**
The `consumer_hash` label is a fixed 16-character hex digest derived from `SHA-256(consumer_url)`.
The raw URL is **never** exposed as a label, preventing:
- Unbounded cardinality from arbitrary customer endpoint URLs
- PII or credential leakage through metric labels

Both the Redis-backed (`RedisWebhookCircuitBreakerStore`) and in-memory-fallback
(`InMemoryWebhookCircuitBreakerStore`) code paths emit this metric, so counters remain
accurate during a Redis outage.

### State machine

```
closed ──(threshold reached)──▸ open
  open  ──(reset period elapsed)──▸ half-open
half-open ──(probe succeeds)──▸ closed
half-open ──(probe fails)──▸ open
```

Thresholds: the circuit opens on the `WEBHOOK_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`-th consecutive
retryable failure (default `0` = disabled) and stays open for
`WEBHOOK_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RESET_MS` (default `300000`) before one half-open probe is admitted.
The full transition table, and the per-receiver state exposed by
`GET /internal/webhooks/circuit-breakers?endpointUrl=…` (including the machine-readable
`reason` a receiver's deliveries are paused and the `resumeAt` timestamp), are documented in
[`docs/webhooks.md`](webhooks.md#circuit-breaker-resilience).

### PromQL examples

**Total transitions into `open` state** (circuit breaker tripping rate):

```promql
sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{to_state="open"}[5m])) by (consumer_hash)
```

**Breakers currently in `open` state** (approximation — count recent open→half-open and closed→open transitions minus recoveries):

```promql
sum(increase(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{to_state="open"}[1h])) by (consumer_hash)
-
sum(increase(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="open"}[1h])) by (consumer_hash)
```

**Half-open probes succeeding vs failing** (recovery health):

```promql
sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="half-open",to_state="closed"}[5m]))
sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="half-open",to_state="open"}[5m]))
```

### Alerting rules

```yaml
groups:
  - name: webhook-circuit-breaker
    rules:
      - alert: WebhookCircuitBreakerOpenRateHigh
        expr: sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{to_state="open"}[5m])) by (consumer_hash) > 0.1
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Webhook circuit breaker tripping frequently for consumer {{ $labels.consumer_hash }}"

      - alert: WebhookCircuitBreakerStuckOpen
        expr: increase(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="half-open",to_state="open"}[1h]) > 3
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Webhook consumer {{ $labels.consumer_hash }} circuit breaker repeatedly re-opening — endpoint may be down"
```

### WebSocket Micro-Batching Metrics

## Indexer Batch RED Metrics

The indexer's per-ledger-batch processing step in `src/indexer/service.ts` is
instrumented with a Rate / Errors / Duration triad defined in
`src/metrics/indexerRed.ts`. It deliberately mirrors the HTTP RED metrics
(`http_requests_total` / `http_request_duration_seconds`) so an indexer
dashboard can reuse the same PromQL shapes and panel layouts as the HTTP one.

### Metric-to-metric parity with HTTP

| Concern | HTTP | Indexer batch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rate | `http_requests_total` | `indexer_batches_processed_total` |
| Errors | 5xx slice of `http_requests_total` | `indexer_batch_errors_total` |
| Duration | `http_request_duration_seconds` | `indexer_batch_duration_seconds` |
| "which work" label | `route` | `contract_id` |
| "what happened" label | `status_code` | `outcome` |

### Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Labels / Buckets |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `indexer_batches_processed_total` | Counter | Every batch processing step executed, successful, partial, or failed. | `contract_id`, `outcome` (`success` \| `partial` \| `error`) |
| `indexer_batch_errors_total` | Counter | Batch processing steps that failed — wholly (`outcome="error"`) **or** partially (`outcome="partial"`). | `contract_id`, `error_source` (`stellar_rpc` \| `local`), `error_type` |
| `indexer_batch_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Wall-clock duration of one batch processing step. | `contract_id`, `outcome`; buckets `[0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 30, 60]` |

**What counts as one batch processing step?** One iteration of the `replayEvents`
loop body that calls `processBatch` — fetch the batch, insert into
`contract_events`, advance the cursor, `COMMIT`. Loop guards (shutdown,
leadership, replay budget) run *outside* the timer, so the histogram measures
work rather than control flow.

A batch that fetched zero rows (source exhausted ahead of the counted total) is
still recorded as one `success`: a unit of work was performed. This is the one
place where `indexer_batches_processed_total` can exceed the pre-existing
`indexer_replay_batches_committed_total`, which counts only batches that reached
`COMMIT`.

### `outcome="partial"` — a batch that did work but did not land

A batch does not only fail by throwing. The common case in ingestion is a
**partial** failure: the batch ran and produced rows, and those rows were then
discarded. Today the replay loop hits this whenever a stop is requested
mid-batch — `ReplayBatchRunner.processBatch` rolls the in-flight transaction
back before `COMMIT`, so every row the batch fetched is dropped and the ledger
range is **not** advanced. Nothing throws on that path.

Recording such a batch as a `success` is what let the error rate report a
healthy zero while rows were being thrown away. `recordIndexerBatchPartialFailure`
instead records all three RED signals:

- `indexer_batches_processed_total{outcome="partial"}` — the batch is in the
  denominator exactly once.
- `indexer_batch_duration_seconds{outcome="partial"}` — the work was done, so the
  duration is meaningful.
- `indexer_batch_errors_total{error_source="local", error_type="batch_aborted"}` —
  the partial failure is counted **as an error**, so the error-ratio query below
  needs no change and never understates the failure rate.

The `outcome` label is the authoritative whole-vs-partial split;
`error_type="batch_aborted"` identifies the partial drop on the error counter.
The reason is a closed union (`batch_aborted`, `unknown`), normalised at record
time, so a widened caller cannot mint a new series.

### `error_source` — upstream vs. local failures

The `error_source` label answers "is this our problem or the RPC provider's?"
without opening a log.

| `error_source` | Origin | `error_type` values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `stellar_rpc` | A call into `src/services/stellar-rpc.ts` failed. Retrying the indexer will not help until the provider recovers. | `timeout`, `network`, `provider`, `circuit_open`, `cancelled` |
| `local` | The failure was raised inside the indexer process, or the batch only partially succeeded. Actionable by the indexer owner. | `db_pool_exhausted`, `db_query_timeout`, `db_duplicate_entry`, `db_error`, `batch_aborted`, `unknown` |

`error_type` for `stellar_rpc` mirrors the `RpcFailureKind` union exported by
`src/services/stellar-rpc.ts` (lower-snake-cased). Classification is structural
— it matches on the error's `name` and `kind`, so a `RpcProviderError` rethrown
by an intermediate layer is still attributed to `stellar_rpc`.

Every increment of `indexer_batch_errors_total` is paired with an
`outcome="error"` or `outcome="partial"` increment of
`indexer_batches_processed_total`, so the error ratio is well-defined against
either denominator.

### Dashboard queries

```promql
# Rate — batches/sec being processed, per contract
sum(rate(indexer_batches_processed_total[5m])) by (contract_id)

# Errors — overall error ratio (includes partial failures)
sum(rate(indexer_batch_errors_total[5m]))
  / sum(rate(indexer_batches_processed_total[5m]))

# Errors — is it us or the provider?
sum(rate(indexer_batch_errors_total[5m])) by (error_source, error_type)

# Partial failures — share of batches that did work but were dropped
sum(rate(indexer_batches_processed_total{outcome="partial"}[5m]))
  / sum(rate(indexer_batches_processed_total[5m]))

# Duration — p50 / p95 / p99 of a batch
histogram_quantile(0.50, sum(rate(indexer_batch_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(indexer_batch_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(indexer_batch_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
```

### Cardinality and data-safety notes

- `contract_id` is trimmed and truncated to 64 characters (the same convention
  as `indexer_replay_*`), and blank/absent ids collapse to `unknown`. A
  malformed replay request cannot mint an unbounded label value.
- Replay is reachable only via `POST /api/indexer/events/replay`, which requires
  a JWT carrying `Permission.INDEXER_REPLAY`, so `contract_id` values are not
  attacker-supplied from unauthenticated traffic.
- `error_source` and `error_type` are drawn from closed unions in
  `src/metrics/indexerRed.ts`. **Raw error messages are never used as label
  values**, so an error carrying user input, credentials, or PII cannot leak
  into the `/metrics` payload or inflate cardinality.
- The partial-failure reason is normalised against a closed allow-list, so an
  unrecognised value collapses to `unknown` instead of becoming a new series.
- The classifier is total: a thrown string, `null`, or an unrecognised object
  yields `local` / `unknown` rather than throwing. Metric recording can never
  mask the original batch failure — the error is always rethrown to the caller.
- `tests/metrics/indexerRed.test.ts` drives both the abort path and the
  wholly-failed path and asserts the published `/metrics` values.


## Config reload metrics (SIGHUP)

Hot-config refresh emits the following Prometheus series (no secret labels):

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `fluxora_config_reload_total` | Counter | `result` (`success` / `failure` / `noop`) | Reload attempts |
| `fluxora_config_reload_duration_seconds` | Histogram | — | Refresh wall-clock duration |
| `fluxora_config_reload_generation` | Gauge | — | Last successfully applied generation |

## Metric label cardinality

See [metric-cardinality.md](./observability/metric-cardinality.md) for the
policy that bounds Prometheus label values (no stream IDs, path parameters,
or tenants as labels). Enforcement: `src/metrics/cardinality.ts`.
