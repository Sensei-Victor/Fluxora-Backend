/**
 * GraphQL schema for Fluxora Backend experimental federation gateway.
 *
 * Defines a minimal read-only schema over streams and audit-log data, backed
 * by the existing repository layer.  The schema is intentionally kept small
 * and can be extended as consumer requirements evolve.
 *
 * ## Security
 *
 * - All queries are read-only — no mutations are exposed.
 * - The schema is only mounted when the `experimental_graphql_gateway`
 *   feature flag is enabled (see `gateway.ts`).
