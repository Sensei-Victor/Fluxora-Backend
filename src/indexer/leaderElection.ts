/**
 * Redis-backed leader election for indexer replay in multi-replica deployments.
 *
 * Only one backend instance may hold the lease at a time. The lease is
 * acquired with `SET NX PX` (via `RedisClient.setNx`) and renewed on a
 * heartbeat well before it expires. If renewal stops succeeding — because
 * another instance has taken over, or Redis is unreachable — `isLeader()`
 * flips to `false` so callers can abort in-flight work at a safe boundary.
 *
 * Modeled on `RedisDistributedLock` in `src/state/adminStateLock.ts`, with
 * lease renewal added since replay runs can far outlive a single lock TTL.
 *
 * ## Clock-anomaly safety
 *
 * Lease expiry is enforced by the Redis server, which uses its own monotonic
 * clock (server-side TTL via `SET … PX` / `PEXPIRE`). This means NTP jumps or
 * wall-clock skew on the local node do not affect *when* the key expires in
 * Redis — only the Redis server's clock matters for lease validity.
 *
 * The remaining local-clock risk is in the heartbeat scheduler: if the process
 * is paused (GC, VM suspend, NTP step-forward) long enough that the renewal
 * interval fires *after* the Redis TTL has already lapsed, another instance
 * may have legitimately acquired the lease. In that case `renew()` will detect
 * the key is held by someone else and self-revoke on the next tick — the
 * correct safe outcome.
 *
 * To make this behaviour explicit and independently testable the implementation
 * tracks `_lastRenewAttemptMs` (wall-clock time of the previous heartbeat tick)
 * using an injectable `clockNowMs` function. When the elapsed time since the
 * last renewal attempt **exceeds the full lease duration**, the process
 * conservatively self-revokes without contacting Redis — any leader that was
 * unable to contact Redis for a full lease period cannot know whether its lease
 * is still valid, so dropping leadership is the safe choice.
 *
 * Backward clock jumps (NTP step-back, monotonic counter reset after reboot)
 * are handled by clamping: elapsed time is treated as zero whenever
 * `clockNowMs() < _lastRenewAttemptMs`, so a backward step never causes a
 * spurious self-revocation.
 *
 * ### Fencing token
 *
 * Every fresh acquisition atomically increments a shared Redis counter
 * (`FENCE_KEY`). Callers that write to shared state must carry the fencing
 * token and the backing store must reject writes carrying a token older than
 * the current epoch — this prevents a stale leader that missed revocation from
 * committing writes after a new leader has taken over (split-brain prevention).
