/**
 * Indexer domain types for Fluxora Backend.
 *
 * Design constraints
 * ----------------------------------
 * - All amount / balance fields are `DecimalString` (a branded string alias).
 *   This prevents floating-point coercion at the type boundary and makes it
 *   impossible to accidentally pass a raw `number` where financial precision
 *   is required.
 * - Block identity uses both `ledger` (sequence number) and `ledgerHash`
 *   (content hash). The hash is the authoritative identity for reorg detection:
 *   two blocks at the same sequence number with different hashes mean a fork.
 * - `ingestedAt` is always set by the store, never trusted from the caller.
 *
 * Field provenance
 * ----------------------------------
 * For each type below, `types.provenance.md` (kept beside this file) documents
 * whether every field is read from chain data (naming the Stellar ledger
 * structure it comes from) or computed by the indexer (stating the derivation).
 * When adding or renaming a field here, update that document in the same commit.

/**
 * A non-empty string that represents a decimal number (e.g. "100.0000000").

 *
 * `eventId` is the globally unique identifier for a contract event and is
 * the idempotency key for ingestion.  It is derived from the chain as:
 *
 *   `${txHash}-${eventIndex}`
 *
 * where `txHash` is the hex-encoded transaction hash and `eventIndex` is the
 * zero-based position of the event within that transaction.  This composite
 * ensures uniqueness: the same transaction cannot emit two events with the
 * same index, and the same event cannot appear in two transactions.
 *
 * **Replay guarantee**: inserting a `ContractEventRecord` whose `eventId`
 * already exists in the store is always a safe no-op.  The store uses
 * `ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING` (Postgres) or an equivalent in-memory
 * Map check to silently discard the duplicate without mutating the existing
 * row or returning an error.  Callers may therefore replay any ledger range —
 * after a crash, a leader handover, or a chain reorganisation — without
 * additional deduplication logic at the call site.
 *
 * Security note: `payload` is an opaque JSON object sourced from the chain.
 * Any amount-like fields inside `payload` must be validated as DecimalString
 * by the consumer before arithmetic operations.
