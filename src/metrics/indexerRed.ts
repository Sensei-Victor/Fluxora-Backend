/**
 * RED (Rate / Errors / Duration) metrics for the indexer batch processing loop.
 *
 * ## Why a dedicated module
 *
 * `src/metrics/indexerMetrics.ts` tracks *replay-run* level counters
 * (`indexer_replay_*`) — one observation per replay job. Those are useful for
 * backfill progress but cannot answer the three questions an on-call operator
 * asks about the per-batch processing step itself:
 *
 *   Rate      — how many ledger batches are we processing per second?
 *   Errors    — what fraction of them fail, and why?
 *   Duration  — how long does one batch take (p50/p95/p99)?
 *
 * This module provides exactly that triad, mirroring the HTTP RED metrics in
 * `src/metrics.ts` (`http_requests_total` / `http_request_duration_seconds`)
 * so an indexer dashboard can be built from the same PromQL shapes as the
 * HTTP dashboard.
 *
 * ## Naming / label parity with the HTTP RED metrics
 *
 * | Concern  | HTTP                             | Indexer batch                          |
 * |----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
 * | Rate     | `http_requests_total`            | `indexer_batches_processed_total`       |
 * | Errors   | (5xx slice of the above)         | `indexer_batch_errors_total`            |
 * | Duration | `http_request_duration_seconds`  | `indexer_batch_duration_seconds`        |
 * | "what"   | `route`                          | `contract_id`                           |
 * | "result" | `status_code`                    | `outcome` (`success` \| `partial` \| `error`) |
 *
 * Both the rate counter and the duration histogram carry the same label set
 * (`contract_id`, `outcome`) — exactly as the HTTP pair does — so a single
 * PromQL template works for either subsystem.
 *
 * ## Partial failures are errors
 *
 * A batch does not only fail by throwing. The common case in ingestion is a
 * batch that *partially* fails: work was performed, but not all of it landed —
 * e.g. a cooperative stop requested mid-batch rolls the in-flight transaction
 * back, so every row it fetched is discarded and the ledger range is not
 * advanced. Counting that as a success makes the error rate report a healthy
 * zero while data is being dropped.
 *
 * `recordIndexerBatchPartialFailure` therefore records the batch as
 * `outcome="partial"` on the rate counter and duration histogram **and**
 * increments `indexer_batch_errors_total`, so the documented error-ratio
 * PromQL counts partial failures without any dashboard change:
 *
 * ```promql
 * sum(rate(indexer_batch_errors_total[5m]))
 *   / sum(rate(indexer_batches_processed_total[5m]))
 * ```
 *
 * The `outcome` label is what separates a partial failure from a wholly
 * failed one; both land in the error counter, so the total error rate is
 * never understated. Alert threshold: `IndexerBatchPartialFailureHigh` fires
 * when the partial share of processed batches exceeds 1% for 10m — sustained
 * partial failures mean rows are being dropped and a resume is owed.
 *
 * ## Cardinality and safety
 *
 * - `contract_id` is truncated to 64 characters (same convention as
 *   `indexerMetrics.ts`) and falls back to `unknown` when absent, so a
 *   malformed request can never create an unbounded label value.
 * - `error_source` and `error_type` are drawn from closed unions declared in
 *   this file. Raw error messages are **never** used as label values, so an
 *   error carrying user input (or PII) cannot inflate cardinality or leak into
 *   the `/metrics` payload.
 * - The partial-failure reason is normalised against a closed allow-list, so
 *   even a widened or untyped caller cannot mint a new label value.
