/**
 * pgcrypto helper utilities for stream PII encryption.
 *
 * This module centralizes the application-side pieces of the encryption

 *
 * Single-row functions (`computeAddressHash`, `computeAddressHashes`) run
 * synchronously on the main thread — ideal for the request-path where the
 * overhead of worker IPC is not justified.
 *
 * Batch functions (`batchComputeAddressHashes`) offload HMAC computation to
 * a bounded worker_threads pool for large row sets (export endpoint,
 * data-retention purge jobs).  Falls back to synchronous execution when the
 * row count is below the threshold or when worker startup fails.
