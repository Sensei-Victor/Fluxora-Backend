/**
 * Retention purge job — enforces the data-retention policy defined in
 * `src/pii/policy.ts` against live PostgreSQL tables.
 *
 * @module jobs/retentionPurge
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * For every rule in `PURGEABLE_RETENTION_SCHEDULE` the job:
 *
 *  1. Calculates a cut-off timestamp:
 *       `NOW() - INTERVAL '<retentionDays> days'`
 *
 *  2. Queries the target table for candidate rows in bounded batches
 *     (default 500 rows per batch, configurable via `batchSize`).
 *
 *  3. For each candidate row:
 *     a. If the row has `legal_hold = TRUE` → emits a
 *        `PURGE_SKIPPED_LEGAL_HOLD` audit event and moves on.
 *     b. Otherwise → deletes (or redacts) the row inside a transaction
 *        and emits a `PURGE_INITIATED` audit event.
 *
 *  4. Repeats until no more candidates are found for the rule.
 *
 * ## Idempotency / crash-safety
 *
 * Each batch is committed in its own short transaction, so a crash
 * mid-run simply restarts from wherever the last successful commit left
 * off.  Re-running the job after a crash is safe — already-purged rows
 * are gone and will not be selected again.  There is **no separate
 * checkpoint table**: eligibility (`ageColumn < cutoff`, `legal_hold`)
 * is recomputed from live data on every run, so the already-committed
 * batches from a prior (possibly crashed) run are simply absent from the
 * next run's candidate set.  Re-running a fully-converged job (nothing
 * left to purge) is always a safe no-op that reports zero rows.
 *
 * ## Deletion ordering
 *
 * Candidates within a rule are fetched oldest-first
 * (`ORDER BY <ageColumn> ASC`).  This makes purge progress monotonic and
 * deterministic: if a run is interrupted partway through a rule, the
 * oldest — and therefore longest-overdue — rows are always the ones
 * already committed, and a resumed run continues forward in time rather
 * than potentially reprocessing an arbitrary scan order.
 *
 * ## Clock source
 *
 * All cut-off calculations for a single run share one `now` value
 * (`options.now`, defaulting to `new Date()` at call time). It is read
 * once in `runRetentionPurge` and threaded through every rule, so a run
 * that spans a month/ledger boundary in wall-clock time still evaluates
 * every rule against a single, consistent instant.
 *
 * ## Legal-hold exemption
 *
 * Any row with `legal_hold = TRUE` is unconditionally skipped.  In a
 * real (non-dry-run) run this also writes a `PURGE_SKIPPED_LEGAL_HOLD`
 * audit trail entry.  The hold must be lifted by an operator before the
 * next job run for the row to become purgeable.
 *
 * ## Dry-run behavior
 *
 * `dryRun: true` makes the run fully read-only: candidate rows are still
 * counted (so `rowsPurged`/`rowsSkipped` reflect what *would* happen),
 * but no `DELETE`/`UPDATE` is issued against the target table and no
 * audit-log rows are written — including `PURGE_SKIPPED_LEGAL_HOLD` for
 * held rows, which is otherwise written outside the batch transaction.
 * A dry run therefore leaves the database byte-for-byte unchanged.
 *
 * ## Audit trail
 *
 * Every batch that purges ≥ 1 row emits `PURGE_INITIATED` with:
 *   - `rowsPurged`  — count of rows deleted/redacted in this batch
 *   - `cutoffDate`  — ISO-8601 cut-off used
 *   - `table`       — target table name
 *   - `batchIndex`  — 0-based batch counter for this rule
 *
 * Every row skipped due to legal hold emits `PURGE_SKIPPED_LEGAL_HOLD`
 * with the row's primary-key value in `resourceId` for traceability.
 *
 * ## Security assumptions
 *
  * - Table and column names in `PURGEABLE_RETENTION_SCHEDULE` are
  *   developer-controlled constants (not user input) and are safely
  *   interpolated into SQL with identifier quoting.
  * - The job runs with the application's DB principal, which must have
  *   `DELETE` on target tables.  It does NOT require super-user access.
  * - `audit_logs` is append-only at the storage layer (see migration
  *   `1790208000000_audit-logs-append-only`): the `fluxora_app` application
  *   role holds only `SELECT, INSERT` on `audit_logs`, and a
  *   `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger rejects mutations from every other
  *   session.  Retention deletes on `audit_logs` are the single exception:
  *   they must run as the dedicated `fluxora_retention` role.  In
  *   single-role deployments (app and migrations share one principal) the
  *   job instead sets `SET LOCAL app.allow_audit_delete = 'on'` inside the
  *   short batch transaction for the `audit_logs` rule only — normal
  *   request paths never set this flag, so their UPDATE/DELETE attempts
  *   still fail at the database rather than only in application code.
  * - The `legal_hold` check is performed inside the same transaction as
  *   the delete, preventing a TOCTOU race where a hold is set between
  *   the check and the delete.
