/**
 * Write-fence pin: a short-lived, HMAC-SHA256–signed token that instructs
 * downstream read routing to use the **primary** pool for a bounded window
 * after a write, solving the classic "read-your-writes" hazard that arises
 * when reads are spread across replica pools that may lag the primary.
 *
 * ## Protocol
 *
 * ```
 * POST /api/streams          → server issues  X-Fluxora-Write-Fence: <pin>
 * GET  /api/streams?cursor=… → client echoes  X-Fluxora-Write-Fence: <pin>
 *                              server verifies and routes to primary if valid
 * ```
 *
 * ## Pin format
 *
 * ```
 * <pin> = base64url( "v1" + "." + <ts_ms> + "." + <sig> )
 *
 * where
 *   ts_ms = Unix epoch in **milliseconds** (string digits)
 *   sig   = hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256( key, "v1:" + ts_ms )
 * ```
 *
 * A version prefix ("v1") is embedded so future algorithm migrations
 * can be deployed without breaking in-flight tokens.
 *
 * ## Security properties
 *
 * - **Integrity**: HMAC-SHA256 prevents forgery without the server secret.
 * - **Replay resistance**: the timestamp inside the pin is verified against
 *   `RYW_PIN_TTL_SECONDS` (default 30 s).  An expired pin is simply ignored
 *   and the request falls back to normal replica routing — no error is raised.
 * - **Constant-time comparison**: signature verification uses
 *   `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing-oracle attacks.
 * - **Key material**: the first 32 bytes of `JWT_SECRET` are used as the
 *   HMAC key.  `JWT_SECRET` is already required to be ≥ 32 characters by the
 *   env schema, so no additional configuration is needed.
 * - **Stateless**: no server-side storage is required.  Expiry is enforced
 *   purely through the timestamp inside the signed payload.
 *
 * ## TTL
 *
 * The TTL is read from `RYW_PIN_TTL_SECONDS` at verification time (not
 * module load) so it can be changed without a restart in environments that
 * support live env-var updates.  Default: **30 seconds**.  Setting it to
 * `0` disables pin enforcement entirely (all reads go to replica/primary per
 * normal routing).
 *
 * ## Clock-skew tolerance
 *
 * In multi-instance deployments, `issueWriteFencePin()` may run on one
 * replica and `verifyWriteFencePin()` on another moments later.  If the
 * verifier's wall clock is slightly behind the issuer's, `ageMs` can be
 * briefly negative (`Date.now() - issuedAt < 0`) and a freshly issued pin
 * would be rejected with a strict `ageMs < 0` check.
 *
 * Verification therefore allows a small **one-sided** leeway of
 * {@link CLOCK_SKEW_TOLERANCE_MS} (2 s): pins that appear up to that far
 * in the future are still honored.  The upper-bound TTL check is **not**
 * loosened — expired pins remain rejected — so replay resistance is not
 * meaningfully weakened.
